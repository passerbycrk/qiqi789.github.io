## Projects

The following involves a variety of projects pertaining to my researches, courses and personal usages.


- *Statistical Model-based Methods for Observation Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks and for Feature Selection in Classification* \
My dissertation topic

- *Netflix challenge project* \
Worked on Netflix challenge problem to develop a movie recommendation system for users. My implementation achieved an improvement over Netflix's own benchmark by 5.53%. And my score was ever used to be ranked within top 50 on the leader board.

- *Probability Collectives in solving distributed optimization problems* \
Researched and experimented in the Probability Collectives approach. Used it to solve distributed optimization problems. Instead of finding a value for a variable, the Probability Collectives method tries to find a distribution over the variable that optimizes the expectation of an objective function. This approach aimed to provide a robust and scalable solution to the distributed dynamical optimization problems.

- *Adaptive wireless embedded systems for intelligent traffic monitoring and control; Implemented an enhanced version of Green Light District simulation software* \
Implemented an enhanced test-bed simulator for research in Java. Carried on research on the new traffic controllers based on wireless embedded sensors. 

- *Real-time sensor data publishing on the Microsoft Sensor Map* \
A small scale of wireless sensor network was set up in the Engineering building lab to monitor temperature and published the real time sensing data upon the Microsoft Sensor Map. 

- *Cloud Storage Node* \
 Implemented one node in a storage cloud, and it would talk
 to a tracker node which coordinated all the nodes in the
 cloud. This was a class project of CS4830, which was
 intended to create a lightweight storage cloud such as the
 Amazon S3. 
 
- *Personal Web application hub and server clustering* \
 A personal Linux Web server was set up along with installation of a
 variety of open sourced Content Management Systems, such as
 joomla, drupal, mediawiki, Mercury source control
 repository, etc. A portal Web page was developed to provide
 the entry points to all of these Web based applications. The
 purpose was experiencing with different Web-based solutions
 for remote file access, data storage and display, etc. Other
 experiments involved with server clustering for parallel
 computing usage.
 

- *Prototype of Cenwits system using wireless sensor nodes.* \
In the research project, an experimental wireless sensor network was deployed at the first floor of Engineering Building West to track people's moving trails.

- *Lego Mindstorm robot project* \
A final project in the course of Artificial Intelligence. I built a robot which can track the sound source using ultrasonic and sound sensors.

- *Image forgery detection* \
Developed an approach that incorporated Z-score-based correlation coefficient comparison to detect the forgery images. It was implemented in C and shown a successful detection of the content cloning in tempered images.

- *Document management system* \
Programmed in VB with integrated API, database techniques, and ActiveX components, the software provided a convenient way for users to manage document collections.  In addition, it combined with other handy applications such as media player, picture viewer, and web explorer. This software was initially designed and developed for meeting my own needs.
