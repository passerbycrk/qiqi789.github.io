### Tool

The Texts software (<http://www.texts.io/>) is so far the best writing tool I
have ever used. You writing is in markdown format, and looks in plain text in
the software. The back-end is the powerful pandoc. It can transfer your writings
into PDF and HTML files with embedded math and algorithm expressions in latex.
It also works well for Chinese texts with the xelatex. It has to have latex
systems installed previously on your system.

You need a default template for exporting to a PDF. I link one here
([Default.xelatex](<Default.xelatex>)), which I used for writing Chinese
scientific texts. A helpful reference is a xelatex thesis template, especially
in its setup/package.tex, [the site
link](<https://github.com/dustincys/PlutoThesis>).

Citation styles used in pandoc can be found richly on this site,
<https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>. It includes a few Chinese
journal citation styles.

Other tools such as JabRef for bibliography management in bibtex; LaTeXDraw for
latex graphics.
