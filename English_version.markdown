I am a computer scientist and practitioner. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Missouri. My expertise ranges from artificial intelligence, approximation algorithms design and anaylsis, machine learning and data mining, functional programming to parallel and concurrent computing. I also have experiences in Web-based technology and wireless embedded systems.

I'm moving back to China. Previously I was a post-doctoral research fellow at <a href="http://people.cs.missouri.edu/~chengji/jianlin.cheng.html" target="_blank">Dr. Jianlin Cheng</a>'s group working on biological networks  reconstructions using probabilistic graphical models.  My advisor during my doctoral study was <a href="http://www.cs.missouri.edu/~shangy/" target="_blank">Dr. Yi Shang.</a> My dissertation topic covered on optimizing observation selection for decision making, and its applications ranging from wireless sensor networks to feature selection, and information ranking.  I also worked in Communications unit in the
<a href="http://gradschool.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Graduate School</a> at University of Missouri, maintaining the Graduate School's <a href="http://gradschool.missouri.edu" target="_blank">website.</a>, and my supervisor was <a href="http://gradschool.missouri.edu/about-us/contact.php#comm_unit" target="_blank">Dr. Robin Walker</a>.

My interest focuses on interdisciplinary computing researches and applications with an emphasis on practical artificial intelligence, efficient computer algorithm design, analysis and development.  Other interest include machine learning and data mining, functional programming in Scala, Linux, wireless embedded systems, and Web-based technology.
